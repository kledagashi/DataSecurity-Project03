# Data Security Project 03 - Grupi 24 

### General Info 

A [university](https://fiek.uni-pr.edu) team project. 

## How does it work?
The Client and the Server communicate with each other exchanging encrypted messages
1. Exchanging keys
* The client and the server exchange their keys where the private key is protected with their public key.
  * Before the communicating begins the two parts do some sort of handshake!
2. The algorythm which we're going to implement for encrypting messages is [Data Encryption Standard](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des)
3. After the messages are exchanged the messages are decrypted 

### Technologies 
The implementation of the program was made using Java[https://www.java.com/en/] Programming Language.
